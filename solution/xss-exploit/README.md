# XSS Request Collector

You can find a simple Flask application here that prints everything to console that is sent to it.
Combined with `xss-script.js` you can steal the session cookies of users from our vulnerable application.

## Run the application

```bash
python app.py
```

or

```bash
flask --app app run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4000
```
